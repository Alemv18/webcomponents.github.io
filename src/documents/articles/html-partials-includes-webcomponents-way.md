Most of the bigger web project are designed to be modular. We all know that Custom Elements spec provides some modularity on individual HTML Element level. Is that all Web Components could give? Definitely not! Thanks to all specs combined, you can build app sthat are modular on higher level. You can build your app out of many fully featured HTML Documents which inter-operates together, seamlessly. You can replace all your framework-specific, server-side templating engines, advanced portal-like systems with just Web Platform.
